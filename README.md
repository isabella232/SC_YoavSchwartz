# MMVM Screen Cast Samlpe Project
In this project, I demonstrate how to use child view controllers, both using Interface Builder and programatically.
To inspire the learners, I simulate the Maps app, where we have a card that displayes information about annotations selected on a map. This is because I know for a fact that this is quite close to how to maps app is built, and is a great use case where theres a lot going on on one screen.
